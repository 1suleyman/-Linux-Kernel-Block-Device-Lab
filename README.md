# 🐧 Linux Kernel & Block Device Lab

In this lab, I learned how to:

* Identify the exact Linux kernel version running on a system
* Extract the **major version** of the kernel
* View and analyze **kernel-generated messages**
* List **block devices** and distinguish disks from partitions

All tasks were completed using standard Linux terminal commands.

## 📋 Lab Overview

**Goal:**

* Determine kernel version and major version
* Inspect kernel messages
* Identify block devices and their types

**Learning Outcomes:**

* Understand Linux kernel versioning
* Use `dmesg` to view kernel messages
* Use `lsblk` to explore storage devices

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Journey

### Step 1: Check Linux Kernel Version

**Task:** Identify the running kernel version and its major version.

**Commands:**

```bash
uname -r          # Prints the kernel version (e.g., 5.15.0-1083-gcp)
```

* Example output: `5.15.0-1083-gcp`
* Major version can be extracted from the output (in this case, `5`).

💡 **Tip:** The Linux kernel version is formatted as `major.minor.patch[-extra]`.

---

### Step 2: View Kernel Messages

**Task:** Print messages generated by the kernel.

**Command:**

```bash
dmesg
```

* Displays system logs generated by the kernel since boot
* Useful for troubleshooting hardware and driver issues

💡 **Tip:** Use `dmesg | less` to scroll through long outputs.

### Step 3: List Block Devices

**Task:** Identify all block devices and their types (disk vs partition).

**Command:**

```bash
lsblk
```

* Displays all block devices, their partitions, and their type (`disk` or `part`)
* Example output:

```
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   50G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0   30G  0 part /
├─sda2   8:2    0   20G  0 part /home
sdb      8:16   0   10G  0 disk
```

* Count only entries with `TYPE=disk` to determine the number of physical disks

💡 **Tip:** The column headers (`NAME, MAJ:MIN, RM, SIZE, RO, TYPE`) are important for understanding the output.

## ✅ Verification

* Check kernel version: `uname -r` → e.g., `5.15.0-1083-gcp`
* Major version: extract first number (e.g., `5`)
* Kernel messages: `dmesg` → confirms kernel events and system startup messages
* Block devices: `lsblk` → count devices with `TYPE=disk`

## 📌 Key Notes

| Feature              | Command    | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Kernel Version       | `uname -r` | Prints full kernel version                     |
| Major Kernel Version | `uname -r` | Extract first number for major version         |
| Kernel Messages      | `dmesg`    | Lists system messages generated by kernel      |
| Block Devices        | `lsblk`    | Lists disks and partitions; filter `TYPE=disk` |

---

## 💡 Tips / Takeaways

* `uname -r` is your fastest way to check kernel version
* `dmesg` is useful for real-time kernel diagnostics
* `lsblk` helps distinguish **physical disks** from **partitions**
* Always read column headers carefully — they often contain the answer
